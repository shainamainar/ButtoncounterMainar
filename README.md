# README
Note: For a simple project as this, I did not bother create a saved instance state. Instead I locked the orientation in the Manifest File.

## Instructions
Create an app that has three buttons, one for incrementing a counter, one for decrementing the counter, and one for resetting the counter to 0. The counter must be displayed as a TextView and must retain its state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes. There should be no values, such as strings, dimensions, etc. hardcoded in the .java files. They should be maintained and accessed from the appropriate resource files.
